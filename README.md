## Projects


### [Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction](https://github.com/shafmalik/shaf.malik05/blob/main/Files/churn_data.ipynb)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Churn.png" alt="Churn Prediction Project">
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models, leveraging historical customer data. By analyzing customer behavior, we can predict the likelihood of churn and take proactive measures to retain customers. It demonstrates the importance of data-driven decision-making in customer relationship management.

### [Real time stock prediciton with MLOPs deployment](https://github.com/shafmalik/shaf.malik05/blob/main/Files/Tensor.ipynb)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="mlops-cycle.png" alt="Instacart Project">
A real-time stock prediction project powered by LSTM models on historical market data. The real-time stock prediction project leverages machine learning to predict stock prices using historical data and deep learning models like LSTM. It’s backed by a continuous-training MLOps pipeline (retraining, CI/CD, tracking), with a FastAPI inference service currently in staging and nearing production release.

### [Phenotype](https://github.com/shafmalik/shaf.malik05/blob/052b446b25913deb35e561f584a7ff797a806714/Files/Asp.ipynb)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Phenotype.png" alt="News Recommender">
This project is alightweight, production-minded NLP pipeline that classifies clinical progress notes into multiple phenotypes (e.g., diabetes, CHF, COPD) using scikit-learn only—no tensors, no spaCy. It includes section-aware preprocessing, simple negation handling, interpretable features, and a CLI for training on your own notes.
