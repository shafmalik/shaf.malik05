## Projects


### [Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction](https://github.com/shafmalik/shaf.malik05/blob/main/Files/churn_data.ipynb)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Churn.png" alt="Churn Prediction Project">
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models, leveraging historical customer data. By analyzing customer behavior, we can predict the likelihood of churn and take proactive measures to retain customers. It demonstrates the importance of data-driven decision-making in customer relationship management.

### [Real time stock prediciton with MLOPs deployment](https://github.com/shafmalik/shaf.malik05/blob/main/Files/Tensor.ipynb)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="mlops-cycle.png" alt="Instacart Project">
The real-time stock prediction project leverages machine learning to predict stock prices using historical data and deep learning models like LSTM. By implementing an MLOps pipeline, the model is continuously retrained with fresh data, ensuring accuracy and robustness in real-time predictions. The deployment, powered by FastAPI, enables seamless integration for live market predictions, allowing users to access up-to-date stock forecasts.

### [Phenotype](https://github.com/shafmalik/shaf.malik05/blob/052b446b25913deb35e561f584a7ff797a806714/Files/Asp.ipynb)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Phenotype.png" alt="News Recommender">
This project is alightweight, production-minded NLP pipeline that classifies clinical progress notes into multiple phenotypes (e.g., diabetes, CHF, COPD) using scikit-learn onlyâ€”no tensors, no spaCy. It includes section-aware preprocessing, simple negation handling, interpretable features, and a CLI for training on your own notes.
